Dummy-website
This is a dummy website of my planned start-up company WorkDude. This website just shows a remarkable use of CSS. WorkDude is a creative platform which is yet to be developed. This website is just an example of the different properties used in CSS and HTML. Feel free to add a comment on the CSS file so that people who are new to Frontend-development may get our point.
